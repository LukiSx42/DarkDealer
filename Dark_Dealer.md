## Dark Dealer

**The idea**: Discord bot that will allow users to grow and sell drugs to AI's and other people with a custom price market that will change in the future (easy to check value), maybe implement a crypto market too???

**Future/side ideas**: 

- *Crypto market* - (user can buy sell) (based on real prices OR custom price market)
- *Houses/Warehouses* - Able to buy and move to a warehouse/house (able to produce more drugs) each warehouse/house has a limit of how much weed you can grow in it
- *Labs* - Able to buy and produce powder drugs like cocaine, crystal meth, heroin... but also package powder into pills like escay and LSD, lab sizes: Small (producing 50g per round, no upgrades available), Middle (producing 100g per round, but able to produce more and faster with some <u>but not all</u> upgrades), Large (300g per round, all upgrades available) (each upgrade and size will have different taxes and different bills)
- *Police* - If you produce drugs in your place, there will be a chance being raided and swatted, depends if you live in the same place you produce the good stuff or no, also anti-police upgrades??
- *More side activities* - Robberies (rob NPCs and other players and... BANKS???), Do LEGAL jobs (cleaning windows and some shit like that), gambling (blackjack, slots, rulette...), daily rewards (each day user can claim thier daily prize), begging people for money (each X seconds you can beg some NPC for random amount of money)
- *Drug selling* - Dark web to sell drugs (create and take offers from other players) or quick sell to NPCs under price (danger when quick selling to gangs (they could take your stuff withou paying (anti scam upgrades?)) or police might show up aresting you (you will get a timeout for X hours, depends of how much drugs you had)) (you cant see how good a drug is until you examine it (you need to buy it before examining it)
- *Gang deals* - You can cooperate with a gang (they will ask if your product meets the quality they request), they will buy your stuff at a higher price (it needs to be a good quality), but if you scam them (give them cheap shit) they could end the cooperation or kill you. 
- *Calculators* - You can calculate your electricity bills for example or some taxes payed when selling the good stuff
- *Banks* - maybe, just maybe add multiple bank accounts and money laundring to make the game more intresting, but this will make the game a lot harder, if you dont launder your money, police will notice that someting is not right abount your bank balance and they will investigate...
- *Other criminal activities* - Stealing from other players and doing NPC robberies (team of players) (player can get cought and fined (not much, around 300% what the player stole) or sent to prison (small cooldown))
- *Cooldown on commands* - Some comands need to have cooldowns, ex. bank robbery (you can't rob banks instantly so like a 15min cooldown would be nice)

**Electricity + taxes**:

- each apartment/lab/warehouse has a different electricity price (defualt electricity price is 0.35$ per kw/h)
- each time you use an equpment or something that uses electricity, after use it is gonna add $ to your taxes, each 24hours you automaticly pay taxes (you can go into negatives), the amount of $ is calculated like this: (watts/1000 * time-hours) * electricity price * multiplyer (the multiplayer is to make the game intresting, i would use 2 in the start, it seems like a good number)

**Buidlings**:

- Labs (3 types of labs (small, medium, large))
- Warehouses (5 types of warehouses (mini, small...))
- Houses (8 types of houses (appartments, houses, mansions)

**Building upgrades**:

- Lab upgrades:
  - Equipment upgrade (lvl 1-3) (each upgrade boosting the produce time by 4 hours)

**Police**:

- Cooldown calculation => 

**The drug list**:

- Starting drugs:
  - Weed (10$ - gram) (user will be allowed to grow (with taxes and electricity payments)) types: (sativa (outdoor), indica (indoor, great), ruderalis (indoor, bad)
  - Amphetamine (10$ - gram)
- Advanced drugs: (lvl 10+)
  - LSD (?$ - gram)
  - Ecstasy ($? - gram)
- Expert drugs: (lvl 25+)
  - Cocaine (45$ - gram)
  - Heroin (?$ - gram)

**Equipment**:

- **Needed to produce**:
  - Lamps (to grow weed) - LED (cheap and bad for electricity efficiency), HID (expensive, good and good elec. efficiency)
  - Driers (to dry stuff ex. weed) - Clothing drier (cheap, no electricity, slow), electric drier (expensive, consumes electricity, fast (like a lot faster)), electric drier XL (same as *electric dryer* but consumes more and can dry more weed at once)
- **Other**:
  - Microscopes (to examine drugs) - toy (a kids toy, cheap, and not accurate (+- 25% quality), normal (normal price, almost accurate (+- 5%)), expert (expensive, totally accurate))

**Shops/Sites**:

- Weed Store (all your weed growing needs!) - everyting to do with weed will sell here
- Lab equipment (?) - every lab upgrade and equpment will sell here
- Power (Its sience!) - every powder you need to work with labs will sell here
- Market - The market it self...

**Drug production**:

- To produce a drug you need to have seeds/powder first (you are able to buy them from the dark net)
- To produce pills you need to have a Pill maker machine upgrade
- To grow weed you only need a lamp and a pot (pot makes no difference)
- Weed grows 1day and 6hours without any upgrades (more info at *equipment*)
  Any powder drug takes 2 days to produce without any upgrades (more info at *Building upgrades*)

**Drug actions**: 

- buy (seeds) - from eshop (no police attention here + no discounts)
- grow (weed) - plant weed seeds (you need: a pot, lamp) (normally it will grow 1 day and 8 hours or with better light it will grow 20 hours)
- dry (substance) - only: wet weed can be dried (normaly (250grams max) will take 2hours or with electric (25grams max) it will take 30mins or XL 30 mins (200grams max))
- mix (substance + substance) - mix 2 substances together ex. 20g cocaine + 5g baking soda, it will result in 25g *"Cocaine mix"* but the quaility is gonna be worse (quality calculation => bad stuff / final mix size (max 100, you can only sell substances above 50 quality) (50 - terible, 60 - bad, 70 - ok, 80 - good, 90 - excelent, 100 - pure))
- examine (if you have a microscope) - examine how good a drug is + show some info
- sell (drug + place) - you can sell sell any drug/mix (above minimal quality) to anyone, you can chose how (place) 1. Quck sell (sell quicky any amount of drugs) (quality depends on how much you profit from a sale (pre gram)) 2. To a gang (you can sell your drugs to a cooperating gang (quality depends on the gang request)) 3. Market (other people or NPC) (you can take offers or create ones, if you create an offer you can chose if you want this to be a player only offer or NPC only or both) (NPC wont buy your offer if it isnt a good deal, players might cuz people are stupid and you can make good profits)

**Market**:

- Pure market (only pure drugs sell here) (NPC will only take good offers (not overpriced shit))
- Dark market (every mixed drugs sell here) (NPC only take offers that are quality 70+ and good offer)
- NPC market (only NPCs can create offers) (at least 1 offer for each drug needs to be here) (refreshes each 10-30mins (totally random to make it look real))
- Market can't change over 2$ (some stop loss/gain thing, so weed doesn't sell for 250$ per gram...)

**Drug state/type**:

- Plant - 1. wet (cant sell and cant mix) 2. dried
- Pills - 1. pure 2. mixed
- Powder - 1. pure 2. mixed
